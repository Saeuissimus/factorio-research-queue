1.6.9
- This version consists of minor cleanups and refactorizations mostly.
- Fixed a crash that occurred when a research was completed while the GUI was open.
- Added support for faster queue navigation with Alt, Control and Shift modifiers. They behave just like they do for moving technologies.
- Time estimation was improved. It should be able to estimate more accurately modded labs, but I didn't get around to testing it in depth. It didn't crash nor behave strangely at least.
1.6.8
- Experimental version!
- Reworked all GUI elements to use sprite buttons and avoid defining styles for each technology or ingredient.
- Limited redrawing the GUI when there are no changes other than time estimation. This fixes an annoying issue where interaction with the GUI is interrupted at random.
- Added event-local memoization of recursive calls. This improved performance when filtering technologies for certain ingredients.
- Added a whole bunch of localised strings. This opens up the possibility of future localisation efforts.
- Fixed time estimation to take into account saved progress on technologies present in the queue.
- Modified the GUI layout in general in order to stabilize buttons. There is some mild success in this regard, but further work may be needed; especially when taking into account non-default options or localisations other than english.
- The research queue GUI is now destroyed if it is still open when a player leaves. This should mainly result in a performance improvement but ensures stability too in the context of the GUI rework. Thanks to Devious Null for the idea of filtering disconnected players.
1.6.7
- Added Hotkey to open qui
- Right click erases text in search field
1.6.6
- Fixed crush at "__research-queue__/functions/update_queue.lua:167: in function 'updateQ'" - missing styles, added pcall
1.6.5
- Added hint with technology name to technology button
- Fixed scroll didn't reset when filters change
- Now you can shift-click or alt-click up button - this will result in x5 clicks, same for down button
- Now you can control-click or right-click up button - this will result in x50 clicks (likely moving a technology up as high as possible), same for down button
- Now setting ingredients filters will also hide non-researched technologies which have prerequesties not matching given criteria
- Fixed time estimation bug if no research is running
1.6.4
- More fixes
- Added quick search (searches only in english since I didn't figured out how to get Localized name in plain string)
1.6.3
- Fixed crush in GUI when no technology style is generated (this happens somewhere in Angel's mods)
- Moved config to settings
- Added optional dependencies to Angels' mods
- Fixed versions in dependencies
